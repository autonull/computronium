"""torch.compile probe for SubstrateSettleKernel (EqProp/tile settle engine).

Question: does compiling the whole multi-step kernel loop beat the eager
loop, with bitwise-equivalent results? This is the EnergyMinimization
workhorse (D1/D2, EqProp family, tile meshes) — the last launch-bound
settle path.

Method: replicate ``SubstrateSettleKernel.step`` exactly as a functional
compiled loop (digital substrate, no recurrent, momentum=0 — the common
case), verify final-acts parity against the stock kernel, time both.
Recorded numbers live in the printed output and the TODO11 Watch note.
