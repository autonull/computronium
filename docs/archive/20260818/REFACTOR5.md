# REFACTOR5 — Consolidation Completion & Architecture Hardening

**Context**: REFACTOR4 achieved LOOP/FUNNEL/GATE-0/CI SEAMS with MEASURE/RULE structurally complete via relocation. The codebase is green, gate-enforced, and parked at a clean checkpoint. REFACTOR5 addresses the **remaining structural debt** that was explicitly deferred, exempted, or assessed as "coexist" — plus the duplication patterns identified in the architecture review.

**Philosophy**: AGENTS.md priorities — working functionality > consolidation. No semantic changes to training dynamics. Every change routes through an existing seam or adds a new one with a frozen signature. Allowlists ratchet only when a violation is genuinely eliminated.

## Status Summary

| Stream | State | Blockers |
|--------|-------|----------|

| **FUNNEL** | Complete | — |
| **MEASURE** | Complete (coexist decision) | 3 distinct `BenchmarkResult` classes kept as-is |
| **RULE** | Structural relocation done; phase collapse gated | 5→2 dispatch collapse only if research need forces it |
| **REGISTER** | Complete (top `_LAZY` 84→5) | — |
| **PRUNE** | Complete (dead code + redundant tests) | — |
| **STRATEGY DEDUP** | **Complete** | MEP keeps CUDA subclasses + MEP-specific strategies (Dion/Fisher/EP) |
| **EQPROP UNIFICATION** | Complete (backend routing + GPU kernel active) | Kernel MNIST parity run: ~82% (PyTorch ~87%); memory win 1.9–22×; time win small-batch, gap at large batch — deferred tuning (#8/#9) |
| **OPTIMIZER SURFACE** | **Complete** | EP presets registered under OPTIMIZER via mode-forcing wrapper |
| **EXPERIMENT CACHING** | **Complete** | `DatasetCache` + `ModelCache` opt-in via `CoreTrainer`; timing benchmark is manual |
| **ROOT HYGIENE** | **Complete** | All DBs → `artifacts/`; `BIOPL_DB_DIR` env override |

## Session Progress (2026-08-14)

Implemented and verified (all gates green):

### ROOT HYGIENE — DONE
- New `bioplausible/core/_paths.py`: `artifacts_dir()` + `db_path(name)` honoring `BIOPL_DB_DIR` (default `artifacts/`), idempotent `mkdir`.
- Defaults updated to `db_path(...)`: `cli/run.py` `_DB_PATH`/`_STORAGE_URL`, `execution/engine.py` `DB_PATH`, `execution/_state.py` `DecisionLogger`, `knowledge/kb.py` `KnowledgeBase` + `create_knowledge_base`, `experiment/result_sink.py` KB/Failures paths, `analysis/results_cli.py` + `failure_manifesto.py` `--db` defaults.
- Moved all 13 root `.db`/`.db-shm`/`.db-wal` files into `artifacts/`. `.gitignore` already covered `*.db`, `*.db-*`, `artifacts/`.
- `config/omegaconf.py` `knowledge_base_path` left as a static config default (resolved at use).

### LOOP ALLOWLIST — 7→4 entries
- `zoo/mep/__init__.py` + `zoo/mep/optimizers/__init__.py`: removed from `LOOP_ALLOW` (the `loss.backward()` hits were **docstring Quick-Start examples only**, no executable training loops).
- `zoo/optimizers/ewc.py`: `EWC.update_fisher` now delegates to `core.ewc.update_fisher` (was re-implementing with a raw `loss.backward()`); removed from allowlist. `test_optimizer_stubs.py` still passes.
- `zoo/models/eqprop/eqprop_diffusion.py`: **KEPT as a sanctioned local-rule exemption.** Tagged `status_tag("broken")` but remains fully present/importable and covered by 6+ test files. Per decision (2026-08-14), it is **not** a deletion target — it is restoreable and fixable later, so it stays in the allowlist alongside `target_prop`/`forward_only`. No test churn.
- Remaining allowlist: `{eqprop_diffusion, forward_only, target_prop, graph/training}`. `check_seams.py` passes (4 violators ⊆ allowlist).

### OPTIMIZER SURFACE — ADAPTER LANDED
- New `bioplausible/core/local_learning/rules/composite_adapter.py`: `CompositeOptimizerAdapter(LearningRuleOptimizer)` wraps a MEP `CompositeOptimizer`, exposes `step(x=None, target=None)` (preserves both EP `step(x,target)` and backprop `step()` modes) + `zero_grad`. Dependency-free (structural `_CompositeLike` Protocol, no zoo import).
- `zoo/mep/presets/__init__.py`: the 5 EP presets (`smep`, `sdmep`, `local_ep`, `natural_ep`, `smep_fast`) now return `CompositeOptimizerAdapter`. `muon_backprop` stays a raw `CompositeOptimizer` (backprop/gradient mode — wrapping would break its `loss.backward(); step()` contract).
- Export added to `core/local_learning/rules/__init__.py`.
- `CoreTrainer(propagator="smep")` now routes MEP presets through `dispatch_train_step` (adapter carries the `_is_learning_rule` marker).
- **OPTIMIZER registration completed:** `zoo/mep/_registration.py` registers the 5 EP presets (`smep`, `smep_fast`, `sdmep`, `local_ep`, `natural_ep`) under `ComponentCategory.OPTIMIZER` via `register_optimizer` with `credit_assignment_type="equilibrium"`, so `CoreTrainer(optimizer="smep")` also works. A `_ep_optimizer_factory` wrapper forces `mode="ep"` by default (the raw presets default to `mode="backprop"`, which would be a silent no-op under the learning-rule `step(x,target)` calling convention); an explicit `mode` in `optimizer_kwargs` still wins via `setdefault`. `muon_backprop` stays PROPAGATOR-only (gradient/backprop mode). `test_registry_audit` skips the EP entries gracefully (`opt.step()` without x/target raises `ValueError`, caught → skip); 293 audit tests pass.

### EXPERIMENT CACHING — DONE
- New `bioplausible/core/_caching.py` (L1 so `CoreTrainer` can import without an upward edge): `DatasetCache` (keys `task/data_kwargs_hash/batch_size/num_workers/seed/device`, LRU 16, thread-safe) and `ModelCache` (keys `model/config_hash/input_dim/output_dim/device`, stores CPU templates, returns `deepcopy` fresh params, LRU 32, thread-safe). `key()` staticmethods with targeted `# noqa: PLR0913, PLR0917`.
- `CoreTrainer.__init__` accepts optional `dataset_cache`/`model_cache` (default `None` = unchanged behavior). `_setup_data` checks the dataset cache before `resolve_task_from_data_config`; `_create_model` checks the model cache before `construct_model`.
- `CoreTrainerDriver` accepts + defaults `dataset_cache`/`model_cache` (auto-created) and threads them into `CoreTrainer(cfg, ...)`. Test fakes in `test_probe.py` updated to the new constructor.
- New `tests/unit/core/test_caching.py` (4 tests: roundtrip/eviction, order-independent keys, fresh-params isolation, LRU).

### STRATEGY DEDUP & EQPROP UNIFICATION — CONFIRMED COMPLETE
- Strategy dedup already in the tree: `base`/`feedback` re-export from core; `constraint`/`update`/`gradient` subclass core with CUDA fast paths + MEP-specific strategies (`DionUpdate`, `FisherUpdate`, `EPGradient`, `LocalEPGradient`, `NaturalGradient`, `SettlingSpectralPenalty`). No work needed.
- EqProp backend routing already landed: `LoopedMLP.backend` field + `_kernel_backend_step` (tensor↔numpy at the boundary) + `TritonEqPropOps` GPU path. GATE-0 passes (`test_backprop_parity`, `test_equilibrium_parity`, `test_equilibrium_implicit_learns`, `test_parity_snapshots`: 37 passed, 2 xfailed, 1 xpassed — the xpass is the documented pre-existing `eqprop_mlp` parity-drift test). `backend="kernel"` MNIST parity (1%-accuracy) remains a manual GPU/numpy benchmark.

## Session Progress (2026-08-14, second pass — consolidation verification & stale-test sweep)

REFACTOR5 implementation streams were already DONE/gated. This session **verified the completed state end-to-end** and closed the remaining test-debt that the committed code had left behind:

- **Confirmed all streams in-tree:** ROOT HYGIENE (`core/_paths.py`), EXPERIMENT CACHING (`core/_caching.py` + `tests/unit/core/test_caching.py`), OPTIMIZER SURFACE (`composite_adapter.py` + `_registration.py` OPTIMIZER regs), LOOP 7→4 allowlist, STRATEGY DEDUP + EQPROP routing. All verification gates green.
- **Fixed 3 stale tests broken by REFACTOR5 changes** (they were failing at HEAD):
  1. `tests/integration/test_zoo_integration.py::test_registry_optimizer_get_resolves_propagator_preset` — asserted `CompositeOptimizer`; the adapter change means `smep` now resolves to `CompositeOptimizerAdapter`. Updated assertion + docstring.
  2. `tests/unit/experiment/test_training_path.py::test_probe_surfaces_dominant_training_path` — `FakeCoreTrainer` lacked the new `dataset_cache`/`model_cache` constructor params that `CoreTrainerDriver` now threads in. Added them.
  3. `tests/unit/test_rule_space_integrity.py::test_convergence_knob_is_a_wired_lever` — imported `bioplausible.zoo._settling` (moved in a prior refactor); now imports `core.local_learning.settling.settle_state`.
- **Fixed stale doc comment** `bioplausible/graph/inference.py:150` referencing `zoo/_settling.py` → `core/local_learning/settling.py`.
- **Ran `ruff format .`** on 11 pre-existing unformatted files (incl. `tools/check_imports.py`, `tests/...parity*.py`) + `ruff check --fix .` (58 auto-fixes). All 687 files now ruff-format-clean.
- **Full-suite sweep:** `uv run pytest --cov=bioplausible --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=55 -p no:warnings` → **2002 passed, 19 skipped, 5 xfailed, 1 xpassed, 0 failed** (up from 3 pre-existing failures), **65.56% coverage** (floor 55%). The 3 prior failures were the stale tests fixed above — no new regressions.

### GATE-0 re-verified (unchanged)
`uv run pytest tests/unit/validation/test_backprop_parity.py tests/integration/test_equilibrium_parity.py tests/integration/test_equilibrium_implicit_learns.py tests/unit/validation/test_parity_snapshots.py -o addopts="" -q` → 37 passed, 2 xfailed, 1 xpassed (the xpass remains the documented pre-existing `eqprop_mlp` parity-drift test).

---

## Session Progress (2026-08-14, third pass — GPU kernel enablement + low-risk improvements)

REFACTOR5 implementation streams remained complete. This session executed the remaining
manual-benchmark item and two documented low-risk improvements, plus GPU enablement for the
kernel backend.

### GPU KERNEL ENABLEMENT + FUSED TRITON FORWARD STEP — DONE
- **CuPy installed and matched to torch's CUDA 13**: `cupy-cuda13x` (+ `uv remove cupy-cuda12x nvidia-cublas-cu12`). torch ships CUDA 13 (`nvidia_cublas-13.1.1.3`); a cu12 CuPy needed a manual `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` at runtime, which a cu13 CuPy avoids entirely. Now `HAS_CUPY=True` and cupy matmul works in a fresh shell with no env hack.
- **Wired the kernel's real GPU path**: previously `HAS_CUPY=False` forced `EqPropKernel` onto NumPy/CPU even though `TritonEqPropOps` existed — the Triton branch was gated on `HAS_CUPY` and never ran. With CuPy installed the `architecture="layered"` GPU path activates.
- **New genuinely-fused Triton layered MLP-block kernel** in `acceleration/triton_kernels.py::TritonEqPropOps.step_layered_cupy` (+ `_layered_step_kernel`): computes layernorm → W1 → tanh → W2 → residual in a **single launch**, returning `(h_next, h_norm, ffn_hidden)` for the contrastive Hebbian update. The previous `step_linear_cupy` only fused the residual and left ~6 separate cupy launches per settle step. Verified bit-close to the NumPy path (max diff 5.9e-8); `forward_step` now routes through it when on GPU.
- **Verification**: `test_memory_o1`, `test_kernel`, `test_triton_kernel`, `test_triton_integration`, `test_model_kernel_api`, `test_verify_backend` all pass; GPU kernel trains MNIST to ~82% (2 seeds). pyright 0 errors; ruff-clean.

### KERNEL vs BPTT GPU BENCHMARK (time + memory) — DONE (manual)
New `tools/benchmark_kernel_parity.py` runs the REFACTOR5 parity gate (accuracy within 1% of PyTorch path) plus a time/memory comparison. Findings (CUDA 13, fused kernel, max_steps=15):
- **Accuracy parity**: kernel ~82% vs PyTorch ~87% on 2k MNIST samples / 8 epochs — a genuine ~5pt gap with these hyperparams (kernel default `lr=0.001` under-trains; `lr=0.02` closes most of it). Not within the 1% budget. The two engines use different architectures (kernel: embed/W1/W2/head with 4× hidden expansion), so exact parity requires per-engine tuning.
- **Memory**: kernel is O(1)-flat (~11 MB resident regardless of batch) vs PyTorch scaling ~21→50→125→215 MB — a **1.9×–22× memory win** that grows with batch size.
- **Time**: kernel wins at small batch (B=128: 0.24× of PyTorch) but loses at large batch (B=8192: ~14×) due to per-step cupy↔torch round-trips in the fused bridge (device↔host copies per settle step). Both strategies are fully functional; this is a **deferred tuning opportunity** (see New Improvement Opportunities #8).

### IMPROVEMENT #3 — ROBUST CANONICAL HASH (DONE)
`core/_caching.py::_stable_hash` replaced JSON-serialization with a recursive canonicalizer that is order-independent for nested dicts/lists/sets, distinguishes types with equal repr (`{"a":1}` ≠ `{"a":1.0}`), and handles NumPy arrays / torch tensors / non-serializable objects via a stable repr token. New test `test_stable_hash_handles_non_json_and_nested` in `tests/unit/core/test_caching.py`.

### IMPROVEMENT #4 — HARDWARE FACADE CACHING (DONE)
`core/trainer.py::_create_model` now folds `target_hardware` into the `ModelCache` key and caches the **final facade** (Quantized/NoisyLoopedMLP), so a hardware sweep reuses the facade instead of rebuilding it per probe. Extracted `_hardware_meta_for(model_kwargs, model)` so cache hits re-derive the `TrainingMetrics.extra` substrate metadata without re-running the facade constructor. `test_hardware_aware.py` + `test_core_trainer.py` pass (38).

---

## New Improvement Opportunities (discovered this session)

1. **(Resolved)** `test_registry_audit` OPTIMIZER contract — resolved by registering EP presets with a mode-forcing wrapper and accepting graceful skips. No further action needed.
2. **`eqprop_diffusion.py` is a sanctioned KEEP, not a delete target.** Per decision (2026-08-14) it is preserved despite being tagged broken, because it is restoreable/fixable later. If you ever want to genuinely repair it, the entry point is `bioplausible/zoo/models/eqprop/eqprop_diffusion.py` (`EqPropDiffusion.train_step` at the `loss.backward()` site) with its existing tests as the harness.
3. **`_caching.py` hashes `data_kwargs`/`model_kwargs` via JSON; configs containing non-JSON-serializable values (e.g. custom objects) degrade via `default=str`.** Fine for the sweep path; a `pickle`-based or recursive-canonical hash would be more robust if exotic config values appear.
4. **ModelCache stores a CPU `deepcopy`-able template; `_apply_hardware` facade swaps run after cache put.** Verified correct, but the facade is not cached — a `target_hardware` sweep re-builds facades per probe. Low priority.
5. **`core._paths.db_path` is a good shared home for the `BIOPL_DB_DIR` knob. (Resolved this session)** The old `config/omegaconf.py::knowledge_base_path` field was dead config — grep confirmed no consumer reads it (the real KB path lives in `knowledge/kb.py` + `experiment/result_sink.py`, both already routed through `db_path()`). Per AGENTS.md DRY / remove-dead-code, the field was **removed** rather than wired (wiring a no-op would have triggered import-time I/O). `config/omegaconf.py` is now consistent with `db_path()` because no stale path default remains.
6. **The focused verification set in the plan missed 3 stale tests that the full-suite sweep caught.** The `OPTIMIZER SURFACE` adapter + `EXPERIMENT CACHING` constructor changes broke `test_zoo_integration`/`test_training_path`/`test_rule_space_integrity` (all failing at HEAD before this session). Lesson: when a stream changes a shared signature (CoreTrainer ctor, preset return type) or moves a module (`zoo._settling` → `core.local_learning.settling`), run the **full suite once** rather than only the targeted files, and grep for stale imports of any relocated symbol.
7. **`bioplausible/zoo/_settling.py` is referenced by at least one stale comment (`graph/inference.py:150`)** — grep confirms the module itself no longer exists and `settle_state` moved to `core/local_learning/settling.py`. Fixed the comment this session; any remaining `zoo._settling` / `zoo/settling` string references in docs or tests should be swept when next touched.
8. **Kernel-vs-BPTT time/memory gap — SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED this session (2026-08-14 pass 4).** Both strategies work. The GPU kernel path was re-engineered for throughput:
   - **Torch-native forward step** (`TritonEqPropOps.step_layered_cupy_torch`): replaced the hand-rolled Triton kernel as the GPU default — zero-copy cupy↔torch views (no device→host round-trip) + cuBLAS matmuls are ~8x faster than the Triton kernel for the FFN shapes (128→512→128). The Triton kernel remains as a fused alternative.
   - **Cached weight tensors**: converted torch weight/biases tensors are cached on the source cupy arrays (invalidated in `adam_update`), so weights convert once per settle, not per step.
   - **Fixed a correctness bug**: torch `std()` defaults to Bessel correction (n-1); the NumPy path uses population std (ddof=0). Added `correction=0` to match — this was silently shifting the layernorm and inflating the CPU↔GPU training gap.
   - **Results (CUDA 13, max_steps=15, lr=0.02)**: memory win 2.3×–12× (kernel flat ~11 MB vs PyTorch scaling to ~135 MB); time at B=512 is 0.24× (kernel faster); B=2048 is 1.25×; B=8192 is 2.12× (down from 14× at session start). The remaining large-batch time gap is because the kernel runs 2 full settles (free+nudged × 15 steps) with spectral norm each step while PyTorch converges early — a per-engine work difference, not conversion overhead.
   - **Remaining tuning paths**: (a) run fewer settle steps via early-convergence (the kernel currently always hits `max_steps`), (b) fold spectral norm into the cached path, (c) batch-level optimizations. Entry point: `bioplausible/acceleration/triton_kernels.py::step_layered_cupy_torch`.
9. **Kernel accuracy parity (~4-5pt below PyTorch) is a hyperparameter/architecture mismatch, not a correctness bug.** The kernel's `embed/W1/W2/head` architecture (4× hidden expansion, single-FFN forward) differs structurally from the PyTorch `EquilibriumMLP` (multi-layer `Linear` + per-layer recurrent `W_rec`, settled jointly). Tuning this session: `max_steps=20` + `beta=0.22` + `lr=0.02` raised the kernel to 82.5–83.5% (from 82.1% at defaults) but the remaining gap is seed-sensitive (~81–84%) and not closable via kernel hyperparameters alone — closing it needs a kernel-side architecture match (deferred, low priority). Benchmark tool defaults updated to the tuned config.

---

## Details Facilitating Future Work

- **Re-entry is unchanged and green:** `uv run python tools/check_imports.py` (exit 0), `tools/check_seams.py` (exit 0), GATE-0 (`uv run pytest tests/unit/validation/test_backprop_parity.py tests/integration/test_equilibrium_parity.py tests/integration/test_equilibrium_implicit_learns.py tests/unit/validation/test_parity_snapshots.py -o addopts="" -q` → 37 passed, 2 xfailed, 1 xpassed).
- **Affected files to watch in future diffs:** `core/_caching.py`, `core/_paths.py`, `core/local_learning/rules/composite_adapter.py`, `core/local_learning/rules/__init__.py`, `core/trainer.py` (constructor + `_setup_data`/`_create_model` + `_hardware_meta_for`), `experiment/probe.py` (`CoreTrainerDriver`), `zoo/mep/presets/__init__.py`, `zoo/mep/_registration.py`, `zoo/optimizers/ewc.py`, `zoo/mep/__init__.py`, `zoo/mep/optimizers/__init__.py`, `execution/{engine,_state,__init__}.py`, `cli/run.py`, `knowledge/kb.py`, `experiment/result_sink.py`, `analysis/{results_cli,failure_manifesto}.py`, `tools/check_seams.py`, `tools/benchmark_kernel_parity.py`, `acceleration/kernels.py`, `acceleration/triton_kernels.py`, `tests/unit/core/test_caching.py`, `tests/unit/experiment/test_probe.py`, plus the 3 stale tests fixed earlier (`tests/integration/test_zoo_integration.py`, `tests/unit/experiment/test_training_path.py`, `tests/unit/test_rule_space_integrity.py`).
- **New dependency:** `cupy-cuda13x` (matches torch's CUDA 13; no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` hack needed). Kernel backend is now GPU-active when CuPy + Triton are present; `HAS_CUPY`/`HAS_TRITON_OPS` in `acceleration/kernels.py` gate the path. On CPU-only environments the kernel degrades gracefully to NumPy.
- **Ruff/pyright cleanliness:** all newly added files are ruff-clean and pyright-clean (0 errors). Edited pre-existing files are at their exact baseline ruff counts (no new violations introduced). Remaining lint warnings in `core/trainer.py`/`experiment/probe.py` are pre-existing project debt.
- **Verification set run this session:** targeted files all green (GATE-0, caching, core trainer, probe, MEP integration, optimizer stubs, eqprop models, gradient equivalence, refactor2 bugfixes) **plus a full-suite sweep**: `uv run pytest --cov=bioplausible --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=55 -p no:warnings` → 2002 passed, 19 skipped, 5 xfailed, 1 xpassed, 0 failed, 65.56% coverage (floor 55%). `check_imports` + `check_seams` exit 0.

## Work Streams

### 1. STRATEGY DEDUP — Unify Gradient/Update/Constraint/Feedback Strategies  **[DONE]**

**Problem**: Two parallel hierarchies implementing the same concepts:

| Location | Purpose | Key Classes |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `core/optimization/strategies/` | Core optimizer strategies | `GradientStrategy`, `UpdateStrategy`, `ConstraintStrategy`, `FeedbackStrategy` |
| `zoo/mep/optimizers/strategies/` | MEP preset strategies | `GradientStrategy`, `UpdateStrategy`, `ConstraintStrategy`, `FeedbackStrategy` |

**Decision**: `core/optimization/strategies` is the canonical L1 location. `zoo/mep/optimizers/strategies` becomes a thin re-export/adapter layer.

**Actions**:
1. **Audit equivalence** — For each strategy pair (e.g., `MuonUpdate` in both), verify identical signatures and behavior. Document any semantic differences.
2. **Consolidate implementations** — Move unique MEP strategies to `core/optimization/strategies` (e.g., `DionUpdate`, `FisherUpdate`, `NaturalGradient`, `ErrorFeedback`, `NoFeedback`, `NoConstraint`, `SpectralConstraint`).
3. **Update MEP imports** — `zoo/mep/optimizers/__init__.py` and `zoo/mep/presets/__init__.py` import from `core.optimization.strategies`.
4. **Delete duplicate files** — Remove `zoo/mep/optimizers/strategies/{gradient,update,constraint,feedback,base}.py`.
5. **Verify** — `smep`, `sdmep`, `local_ep`, `natural_ep`, `muon_backprop`, `smep_fast` presets produce identical optimizer instances.

**Allowlist impact**: None (internal consolidation).

---

### 2. EQPROP UNIFICATION — Single Engine with Backend Selection  **[DONE — kernel routing landed]**

**Problem**: Three EqProp implementations with overlapping capability:

| Engine | Location | Memory | Backend | Use Case |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| `EquilibriumMLP` | `zoo/models/eqprop/_energy.py` | O(N) activations | PyTorch autograd | Layered, consolidated engine |
| `LoopedMLP` | `zoo/models/eqprop/looped_mlp.py` | O(1) implicit / O(N) contrastive | PyTorch | Facade over `EquilibriumMLP`; 3-arg legacy ctor |
| `EqPropKernel` | `acceleration/kernels.py` | **O(1) contrastive** | NumPy/CuPy/Triton | No autograd; FPGA/neuromorphic path |

**Decision**: `EquilibriumMLP` is the canonical PyTorch engine. `LoopedMLP` remains the registered facade (`eqprop_mlp`). `EqPropKernel` becomes a selectable **backend** via `TrainerConfig.target_hardware` or a new `backend` field, not a separate model class.

**Actions**:
1. **Add backend routing to `LoopedMLP`** — Extend `ModelConfig.extra` or `TrainerConfig` with `eqprop_backend: Literal["pytorch", "kernel", "triton"]`.
2. **Wire `EqPropKernel` into `CoreTrainer`** — In `dispatch_train_step`, when `model.backend == "kernel"` and `gradient_method == "contrastive"`, delegate to `EqPropKernel.train_step` (convert tensors ↔ arrays at boundary).
3. **Unify hyperparameters** — Ensure `beta`, `settle_steps`, `settle_lr`, `gamma`, `max_steps` map 1:1 between `ModelConfig` and `EqPropKernel` constructor.
4. **Expose Triton path** — `EqPropKernel` already has `TritonEqPropOps`; make it the default GPU path when `HAS_TRITON` and `use_gpu`.
5. **Deprecate implicit-equilibrium path for kernel backend** — The O(1) implicit path (`gradient_method="equilibrium"`) is PyTorch-only; kernel backend uses contrastive Hebbian exclusively.
6. **Verify parity** — Run GATE-0 suite + `test_equilibrium_parity.py` with `backend="kernel"` on MNIST; accuracy within 1% of PyTorch path.

**Allowlist impact**: None (new backend, existing models unchanged).

---

### 3. OPTIMIZER SURFACE — Single Learning-Rule Optimizer Protocol  **[ADAPTER DONE; OPTIMIZER reg deferred]**

**Problem**: Two incompatible calling conventions for learning-rule optimizers:

| Surface | Location | Signature | Used By |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| `LearningRuleOptimizer` (Protocol) | `core/local_learning/rules/base.py` | `step(self, x, target)` | `CoreTrainer.dispatch_train_step`, `bioplausible.__init__` lazy exports |
| `CompositeOptimizer` | `zoo/mep/optimizers/composite.py` | `step(self)` (internal state) | `zoo/mep/presets` (`smep`, `sdmep`, etc.) |

**Decision**: `LearningRuleOptimizer` Protocol is the canonical L1 interface. `CompositeOptimizer` adapts to it via a wrapper.

**Actions**:
1. **Create adapter** — `core/local_learning/rules/composite_adapter.py`: `CompositeOptimizerAdapter(LearningRuleOptimizer)` wraps `CompositeOptimizer`, implements `step(x, target)` by running the composite's internal phases.
2. **Update MEP presets** — `zoo/mep/presets/__init__.py` returns `CompositeOptimizerAdapter(composite)` instead of raw `CompositeOptimizer`.
3. **Unify registration** — Register MEP presets via `register_optimizer` (canonical) with `credit_assignment_type="equilibrium"`. Remove duplicate registration paths.
4. **Verify** — `CoreTrainer` with `optimizer="smep"` works identically; `_is_learning_rule_optimizer` guard passes for adapted instances.

**Allowlist impact**: None (adapter preserves external behavior).

---

### 4. EXPERIMENT CACHING — Eliminate Per-Probe Redundancy  **[DONE]**

**Problem**: Each probe in `StaircaseRunner` re-instantiates:
- `DomainTask` + `DataLoader` (dataset download, transform, split)
- Model via `construct_model` (weights, buffers, optimizer state)

**Decision**: Add caching layer in `ProbeDriver` (L5) with explicit invalidation keys.

**Actions**:
1. **Dataset cache** — `ProbeDriver.__init__` accepts `dataset_cache: DatasetCache | None`. `DatasetCache` keyed by `(task_name, data_kwargs_hash, batch_size, num_workers, seed)`. Returns `(train_loader, val_loader, task_spec)` tuple.
2. **Model construction cache** — `ProbeDriver` accepts `model_cache: ModelCache | None`. `ModelCache` keyed by `(model_name, config_hash, input_dim, output_dim, device)`. Returns `nn.Module` with fresh parameters (state dict not cached).
3. **Integrate into `CoreTrainerDriver`** — Before `Registry.get` + `construct_model`, check cache. On cache miss, construct and store.
4. **Invalidation** — Cache key includes `config_hash` (SHA256 of canonical config via `config_key()`). Any hyperparameter change = new entry.
5. **Memory bound** — `ModelCache` uses `weakref.WeakValueDictionary` + LRU eviction (max 32 entries default).
6. **Verify** — Run a 10-model × 5-config × 3-seed campaign; measure probe startup time (target: <500ms cold, <50ms warm).

**Allowlist impact**: None (internal optimization).

---

### 5. ROOT HYGIENE — Artifact Organization  **[DONE]**

**Problem**: 12+ `.db` files in project root:
```
bioplausible.db, bioplausible2.db, bioplausible_kb.db,
compute_phase1_5.db, compute_phase1_5_v2.db, compute_phase1_5_v3.db,
compute_phase1_5_v3.backup.db, dummy.db, execution_state.db,
smoke.db, smoke_p15.db
```

**Decision**: All experiment artifacts → `artifacts/` (already exists). SQLite databases are experiment outputs, not source code.

**Actions**:
1. **Move existing DBs** — `mv *.db artifacts/` (preserve git history with `git mv`).
2. **Update connection strings** — Search for hardcoded `"bioplausible.db"`, `"sqlite:///bioplausible.db"`:
   - `hyperopt/storage.py:HyperoptStorage.__init__`
   - `cli/run.py:_DB_PATH`, `_STORAGE_URL`
   - `execution/_lifecycle.py:CheckpointManager`
   - `experiment/result_sink.py`
   - `bioplausible/execution/engine.py`
   - Replace with `artifacts/bioplausible.db` or environment variable `BIOPL_DB_DIR`.
3. **Add `.gitignore`** — `artifacts/*.db`, `artifacts/*.db-*` (WAL/SHM).
4. **Verify** — All HPO, checkpoint, and KB operations write to `artifacts/`; tests pass.

**Allowlist impact**: None (path change only).

### 6. LOOP ALLOWLIST — Resolve Remaining Exemptions  **[7→4; eqprop_diffusion is a sanctioned KEEP]**

**Current `LOOP_ALLOW` entries** (from `tools/check_seams.py`):

| File | Reason | Resolution Target |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| `zoo/mep/__init__.py` | Inline MEP training loop (deferred) | Convert when touched (STRATEGY DEDUP enables this) |
| `zoo/mep/optimizers/__init__.py` | Inline MEP training loop (deferred) | Convert when touched (STRATEGY DEDUP enables this) |
| `zoo/models/target_prop.py` | Pure local `train_step` (target propagation) | **Keep** — legitimate bio-plausible local rule |
| `zoo/models/eqprop/eqprop_diffusion.py` | Tagged broken/deferred | **KEEP** — sanctioned local-rule exemption; restoreable/fixable later |
| `zoo/optimizers/ewc.py` | EWC loss-rule body (Fisher step moved to core) | Move `compute_ewc_loss` to `core/ewc.py`; zoo file becomes re-export |
| `graph/training.py` | Bespoke GraphStructure + param-dict (PCN) | **Keep** — documented exemption |

**Actions**:
1. **`eqprop_diffusion.py` is a sanctioned KEEP** — decision 2026-08-14. Despite being tagged broken, it is not a deletion target; it is fully present, importable, and covered by its existing tests, and is fixable later. Leave it in `zoo/models/eqprop/__init__.py` exports and the `LOOP_ALLOW` allowlist.
2. **Move EWC loss rule** — `zoo/optimizers/ewc.py:compute_ewc_loss` → `core/ewc.py`; `zoo/optimizers/ewc.py` becomes `from bioplausible.core.ewc import compute_ewc_loss, register_ewc, update_fisher`.
3. **Convert MEP inline loops** — After STRATEGY DEDUP, `zoo/mep` presets return `CompositeOptimizerAdapter`; `zoo/mep/__init__.py` and `optimizers/__init__.py` lose their training loops. Remove from `LOOP_ALLOW`.
4. **Ratchet allowlist** — Edit `tools/check_seams.py:LOOP_ALLOW` to remove cleared entries.

**Verify**: `tools/check_seams.py` passes with smaller allowlist; GATE-0 suite green.

### 7. RULE PHASE COLLAPSE — Gate Decision

**Status**: Gated (high-risk, low-payoff). Current `dispatch_train_step` has 5 phases:
1. Energy model (`EnergyModel` → `EBMTrainer`)
2. Explicit propagator (`LearningRuleOptimizer`)
3. Model `train_step`
4. Learning-rule optimizer (`LearningRuleOptimizer`)
5. BPTT fallback

**Proposed 2-phase**: Energy model → Model `train_step` → BPTT.

**Decision**: **Do not implement unless a concrete research need forces it.** The 5-phase dispatcher correctly handles:
- Models with implicit equilibrium backward (return `None` from `train_step`)
- Models with contrastive `train_step` (EP, PC, TP, FA, Hebbian)
- Learning-rule optimizers as propagator OR optimizer
- Plain BPTT models

**Trigger to revisit**: A new algorithm family cannot be expressed without contorting the 5-phase dispatch, OR AutoScientist composition logic becomes unmaintainable due to phase complexity.

## Implementation Order

```
1. ROOT HYGIENE          ✅ DONE
2. STRATEGY DEDUP        ✅ DONE (confirmed in-tree)
3. OPTIMIZER SURFACE     ✅ Complete (adapter + OPTIMIZER registrations with mode-forcing wrapper)
4. LOOP ALLOWLIST        ✅ 7→4 (eqprop_diffusion sanctioned KEEP)
5. EQPROP UNIFICATION    ✅ Complete (kernel backend routing already landed)
6. EXPERIMENT CACHING    ✅ DONE
7. RULE PHASE COLLAPSE   (gated — only if triggered)
```

## Remaining Work (see "Session Progress" above for detail)

- **LOOP stream:** resolved at 7→4. `eqprop_diffusion.py` is a **sanctioned KEEP** (broken but fixable later) — no deletion planned.
- **EQPROP:** the manual `backend="kernel"` MNIST parity benchmark is now **run** (`tools/benchmark_kernel_parity.py --gpu`). Kernel is functional on GPU (CuPy-cuda13x + fused Triton forward step), trains MNIST to ~82%, and wins on memory (1.9–22×) and small-batch time. The ~5pt accuracy gap and large-batch time gap are **deferred tuning** (see New Improvement Opportunities #8/#9), not blockers.
- **CONSOLIDATION STATUS:** all implementation streams complete. Full suite green; GPU kernel backend now active. No remaining code work in scope.

## Non-Goals (Per AGENTS.md & REFACTOR4 Ground Rules)

- God-object splits (`core/trainer.py`, `knowledge/kb.py`, `execution/strategy.py`)
- Settling-loop merge (Family A/B) — numerics risk, low gain
- Visualization consolidation — UI preference
- Forced `BenchmarkResult` merge — coexistence sanctioned (ground rule 8)
- Backwards compatibility — NONE per AGENTS.md
