# Bioplausible Research Roadmap

**Goal**: Develop Bioplausible into a *discovery engine* that produces breakthrough results demonstrating bio-plausible learning can match or exceed backpropagation in regimes where backprop fails.

**Strategy**: GPU-first, low-hanging-fruit prioritized, user-recruiting milestones. Defer non-GPU (neuromorphic hardware, analog simulation) until GPU validation is solid.

---

## Phase 0: Foundation Hardening (GPU-Complete)

*Prerequisites for all downstream work. Must be solid before claiming results.*

### 0.1 Backprop Parity Benchmark Suite — **P0 CRITICAL**
**File**: `bioplausible/validation/backprop_parity.py`

Automated, compute-matched comparison infrastructure:
- Identical architectures (MLP, CNN, Transformer) across backprop vs every bio-plausible family
- Compute-matched: same FLOPs, wall-time, peak memory, parameter count
- Statistical rigor: n≥10 seeds, confidence intervals, effect sizes (Cohen's d, Cliff's delta)
- Output: Publication-ready tables + Pareto frontier plots (accuracy vs compute vs memory) + JSON for programmatic analysis
- CLI: `biopl-parity --model eqprop --tasks mnist,cifar10 --seeds 10`

**Target models for parity**: `eqprop_mlp`, `directed_ep`, `feedback_alignment`, `standard_fa`, `forward_forward`, `pepita`, `equitile`, `equitile_ep`

**Tests**: MNIST, CIFAR-10, Tiny Shakespeare, Penn Treebank
**Metrics**: Accuracy, FLOPs/sample, peak memory, wall-time/epoch, energy estimate (Joules).  Be explicit about the Energy model: GPU TDP × utilization × wall-time, or an operation-count-based model (e.g., Horowitz 2014 energy per FLOP)? The former is more honest; the latter is more portable - report both.

Compute-matched definition: "same FLOPs" is ambiguous for equilibrium methods, since settling steps aren't fixed at graph-construction time the way backprop's forward/backward pass is. Decide up front whether you match wall-clock, FLOPs, or settling-steps-to-convergence, and report the tradeoff explicitly rather than picking whichever makes EqProp look best.

### 0.2 Registry Metadata Completeness Audit
**File**: `bioplausible/validation/registry_audit.py`

Verify every registered component for complete, calibrated metadata:
- `bio_plausibility_score` (0.0-1.0, calibrated against ground truth)
- `locality_level` (GLOBAL / LAYERWISE / LOCAL / EQUILIBRIUM / FORWARD_ONLY)
- `memory_complexity` (O(1), O(N), O(N²))
- `requires_backward` (bool)
- `credit_assignment_type` (gradient, equilibrium, hebbian, target, forward-only, spiking)
- `family` tag (eqprop, fa, hebbian, forward_only, target_prop, spiking, predictive_coding, mep, equitile, backprop)
- `provides` / `requires` capabilities (for compatibility checking)
- Instantiates without error on CUDA, runs forward+backward (or local equivalent) on dummy data, produces deterministic output with fixed seed
- Generates registry health report (CI gate)

### 0.3 Deterministic Seeding & Reproducibility
**Files**: `bioplausible/utils/reproducibility.py`, `configs/repro/`

- Global seed manager: all RNGs (torch, numpy, random, CUDA, cuDNN)
- Experiment config hashing for exact reproducibility
- Environment capture: git commit, torch/cuda versions, dependencies hash
- Artifact versioning: model checkpoints, configs, logs with content-addressable storage
- CI smoke test: `biopl-repro-check` runs 1-epoch parity on all models nightly

Gradient equivalence testing (5.2) should be P0, not P1. If EqProp claims approximate gradient equivalence to backprop, that claim needs finite-difference verification from day one. Every EqProp variant should ship with a passing gradient check before it's registered. Otherwise you'll discover subtle bugs later that invalidate published numbers.

## Phase 4: AutoScientist — Autonomous Discovery (GPU-Complete)

### 4.1 LLM Reasoning Upgrade — **P1**
Current: Basic OpenAI calls. Target: **Structured reasoning with experiment context**.

**Enhancements to `LLMHypothesisGenerator`**:
- [ ] **Chain-of-thought templates** for:
  - Failure analysis ("Why did X fail on task Y?")
  - Transfer reasoning ("X works on vision; what changes for language?")
  - Composition reasoning ("Combine EqProp settling with FA feedback")
  - Scaling prediction ("How will this scale to 10x depth?")
- [ ] **Literature retrieval** (arXiv API + semantic search) for prior art
- [ ] **Counterfactual generator** ("What if we changed β schedule?")
- [ ] **Structured output** (JSON schema matching `Hypothesis` dataclass)
- [ ] **Local LLM support** (llama.cpp, ollama) — no API key required

### 4.2 Knowledge Base Synthesis — **P1**
Current: Stores entries. Target: **Generates insights**.

**Add to `KnowledgeBase`**:
- [ ] `run_meta_analysis()` → Periodic synthesis report:
  - Scaling law fits (power law: accuracy ~ params^α, data^β, compute^γ)
  - Algorithm fingerprinting (hyperparameter sensitivity signatures via PCA)
  - Failure manifold mapping (systematic negative results by model/task)
  - Cross-domain transfer matrix (what transfers where)
- [ ] `extract_scaling_laws(model_family, task)` → Returns fitted α, β, γ with confidence
- [ ] `predict_performance(config, target_metric)` → Surrogate prediction with uncertainty
- [ ] `suggest_next_experiment()` → Bayesian optimization over algorithm space

### 4.3 Campaign Persistence & Resume — **P1**
- [ ] AutoScientist state serialization (YAML + SQLite)
- [ ] Resume from arbitrary checkpoint with full context
- [ ] Campaign versioning (git-like: branches for exploration, merges for validation)

### 4.4 Human-in-the-Loop Interface — **P2**
- [ ] Web dashboard for hypothesis review/approval
- [ ] Slack/Discord notifications for milestone results
- [ ] Interactive hypothesis editing


Note: explicitly sequence Phase 4 after Phase 0 + Phase 5.2/5.3 are complete, not in parallel. Otherwise AutoScientist will generate confident-sounding hypotheses on top of unvalidated or buggy numbers, which is a credibility risk once you're trying to recruit users/contributors.

---

## Phase 5: Validation Framework — Scientific Rigor (GPU-Complete)

### 5.1 Validation Tracks — **Complete Registration**

| Track | Status | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Core (correctness) | ✅ | — |
| Scaling (depth/width/data) | 🔄 | P1 |
| Research (novel algos) | ✅ | — |
| Signal (dynamics/gradients) | 🔄 | P1 |
| Tradeoffs (perf vs compute) | 🔄 | P1 |
| Hardware (GPU/CPU/neuromorphic) | ❌ | P1 |
| Application (vision/language/RL) | ✅ | — |
| Architecture Comparison | ✅ | — |
| Negative Results | 🔄 | P1 |

**P1**: Implement missing tracks with standardized protocols.

### 5.2 Gradient Equivalence Testing — **P1**
> Critical for EqProp/MEP claims.

**Add**: `tests/integration/test_gradient_equivalence.py`
- Finite-difference gradient check for every propagator
- Relative error thresholds per algorithm family
- Automatic failure detection + reporting

### 5.3 Statistical Validation Utilities — **P1**
**File**: `bioplausible/validation/statistics.py`
- [ ] Bootstrap confidence intervals (percentile, BCa)
- [ ] Effect size reporting (Cohen's d, Cliff's delta)
- [ ] Multiple comparison correction (Benjamini-Hochberg)
- [ ] Power analysis for experiment sizing
- [ ] Bayesian A/B testing (rope, HDI)

Right now 5.3 (bootstrap CIs, effect sizes, multiple-comparison correction) is listed as a separate P1 deliverable from 0.1 (parity suite), but the parity suite explicitly says it needs "confidence intervals, effect sizes." That's circular unless 5.3's utilities are built first or concurrently.  Fix the dependency order in the file map: statistics.py should be a prerequisite import for backprop_parity.py, not a parallel-track deliverable. Otherwise you'll ship a "publication ready" parity table that then needs retrofitting with proper CIs.


### 5.4 Negative Result Documentation — **P1**
**File**: `bioplausible/analysis/failure_manifesto.py` — structured negative results:
- What was tried, why it should work, why it failed
- Search space explored (hyperparameters, seeds, architectures)
- Partial successes (what *did* work)
- Hypotheses for future work

---

## Phase 6: Novel Algorithm Development (GPU-Complete)

*New models/variations addressing specific gaps identified in Phases 1-5.*

### 6.1 Hybrid Local-Global Architectures
**Files**: `bioplausible/zoo/models/hybrid/`

Address the "pure local learning underfits complex patterns" hypothesis:
- `local_global_eqprop`: EqProp body + backprop head (last 1-2 layers)
- `fa_backprop_head`: Feedback alignment body + backprop readout
- `equitile_global_readout`: EquiTile tiles + global attention readout
- `progressive_locality`: Start global (backprop), anneal to local (EqProp) over training
- Registration: full metadata, parity tests, AutoScientist discoverable

`progressive_locality` (start backprop, anneal to EqProp) is potentially the most impactful idea in the "New Model" table. It sidesteps the cold-start problem of pure local learning and gives a principled interpolation between the two regimes. Consider promoting this to Phase 1 or 2.  If it just recovers backprop performance because the "anneal to local" phase happens after most learning is already done, it's not actually demonstrating bio-plausible learning power — it's demonstrating backprop with cleanup. Design the ablation explicitly to test how early you can start annealing and still retain performance, and report where the crossover breaks.
This should probably get its own dedicated ablation in 7.4 rather than being folded generically into "hybrid architectures."

### 6.2 Spectral/Normalization Variants for Stability

- LIF neurons in tiles, STDP-style local updates
- Surrogate gradients: fast sigmoid, piecewise linear, ATan for backward pass
- Event-driven settlement: only active tiles compute
- Hybrid: spiking tiles + rate-based readout for GPU efficiency
- Benchmark: NMNIST, SHD, DVS-Gesture (neuromorphic datasets)

### 6.4 Structured Topology Variants
**Files**: `bioplausible/equitile/topology/`

Beyond layered grids:
- `cortical_column_equitile`: Mini-columns with local inhibition, long-range excitation
- `hierarchical_equitile`: Multi-scale tiles (coarse → fine) with top-down modulation
- `small_world_equitile`: Watts-Strogatz rewiring for short path length + high clustering
- `modular_equitile`: Specialized tile modules (vision, language, motor) with routing
- Analysis: graph metrics (clustering, path length, modularity) vs performance

### 6.5 Continual/Lifelong EquiTile
**Files**: `bioplausible/equitile/continual/`

- `dynamic_tile_allocation`: New tiles for new tasks, importance-based protection
- `elastic_tile_consolidation`: EWC on tile importance + edge weights
- `replay_from_tiles`: Generative replay using tile dynamics (no stored data)
- `task_agnostic_growth`: Tile splitting/merging driven by error signals, not task labels

| **Sign-Symmetric FA** | FA | Low | Hardware-friendly, no weight transport |
| **EquiTile + MEP** | EquiTile+MEP | Medium | Spectral-constrained tile updates |
| **Spiking EquiTile** | Spiking+EquiTile | High | Neuromorphic native |
| **3D Cortical Column EquiTile** | EquiTile | Medium | Biological realism, structured sparsity |
| **Continual EquiTile (EWC + tile growth)** | EquiTile | Medium | No catastrophic forgetting |
| **Mixture-of-Tiles (MoT) Language Model** | EquiTile | Medium | Sparse activation, scaling |
| **Equilibrium Alignment (EqAlign) + EquiTile** | FA+EquiTile | Medium | Native local alignment |
| **Forward-Forward + EquiTile Tiles** | FF+EquiTile | Low | Zero backward pass tiles |
| **Predictive Coding on Tile Graph** | PC+EquiTile | Low | Local prediction errors |
| **Meta-Learned β Schedule** | EqProp | Medium | Learned nudge annealing |
| **Energy-Based Regularization** | All | Low | Contractive dynamics → robustness |


Mixture-of-Tiles (MoT) is listed as medium effort, but if OptimizedLMEquiTile already implements it (the table says ✅), then the research question shifts to: does sparse tile activation actually help, or does it just add routing overhead? The ablation framework (7.4) should test this explicitly.   Elevate this specific ablation (dense vs. sparse tile routing, controlling for parameter count and compute) to a named flagship experiment (1.7.5), not just a footnote in 7.4 — it's testable now with OptimizedLMEquiTile, doesn't require new infrastructure, and gives a concrete negative-or-positive result either way.

## Recruitment Strategy

### For Users (Researchers/Engineers)
- **5-minute Colab demo** → "See <MODEL> train on your data"
- **Parity benchmark results** → "Here's exactly where we match/beat backprop"
- **Leaderboard** → "Compare your method against 50+ bio-plausible baselines"
- **AutoScientist** → "Automate your architecture search"

### For Contributors (Developers/Researchers)
- **Good first issues** tagged in GitHub (tests, docs, benchmarks)
- **Component registry** → "Add your algorithm in 50 lines, get auto-tuning free"
- **Validation tracks** → "Your method gets rigorous evaluation automatically"
- **Knowledge base** → "Your experiments contribute to collective intelligence"

### For Hardware Partners
- **EquiTile deployment path** → ONNX → Loihi/SpiNNaker/BrainScaleS
- **Energy modeling** → "Predict Joules/sample before tape-out"
- **Tile abstraction** → Maps naturally to crossbar arrays, neuromorphic cores

## Success Metrics (Track in Knowledge Base)

Note: the provided numbers in the following chart are only *examples*; do not take seriously/literally.

| Metric | Target (6 mo) | Target (12 mo) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Backprop parity (CIFAR-10) | ≥ 95% of BP accuracy | ≥ 100% (match) |
| EquiTile CIFAR-100 | ≥ 75% | ≥ 80% |
| EquiTile Tiny Shakespeare | ≤ 1.2 BPB | ≤ 1.0 BPB |
| AutoScientist hypotheses/week | 50 | 200 |
| Registered algorithms | 100 | 200 |
| Active contributors | 10 | 30 |
| Neuromorphic deployments | 1 (Loihi 2) | 3 |
| Citations / papers using framework | 5 | 20 |

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Bio-plausible methods fundamentally can't match BP | Parity suite *proves* where they do/don't; negative results published |
| AutoScientist generates noise | Human-in-loop approval; surrogate-guided filtering; strict validation tracks |
| EquiTile too complex for adoption | Builder API + presets + Colab demos; "production config" one-liner |
| GPU kernels introduce bugs | Reference NumPy kernels + gradient equivalence testing on every commit |
| Neuromorphic gap too wide | Defer until GPU maturity; use simulators for early validation |

---

## Development Principles

1. **GPU-first**: Every feature must run on CUDA before considering other hardware
2. **Registry-driven**: New components auto-discoverable by AutoScientist/hyperopt
3. **Reproducible by default**: Seeds, env capture, artifact versioning mandatory
4. **Publishable output**: Every experiment generates paper-ready figures/tables
5. **Low-friction contribution**: `register_model` decorator + CI validation = 5 min to add algorithm
