"""
Spiking Neural Network propagator (STDP).

Classes: STDPLearningRule

A self-contained spike-timing-dependent-plasticity local rule that operates on
any model exposing ``transition_modules()`` returning ``nn.Linear`` layers. It
rate-encodes the input, propagates spikes forward through the linear layers, and
applies an STDP-style update (pre-before-post potentiation minus a trace-based
anti-Hebbian term) to each layer's weights. This runs entirely via PyTorch and
does not require snnTorch — ``SpikingSTDP`` (``zoo.models.spiking``) remains the
full LIF/snnTorch model that owns STDP internally; this propagator provides an
equivalent local rule through the Zoo propagator interface.

    """Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) local learning rule.

    Rate-encodes the input as spikes, propagates them once forward through the
    model's linear transition layers, and updates each ``nn.Linear`` weight in
    place from the running spike traces    ::

        dw = lr * (A+ * post^T @ pre_trace - A- * post_trace^T @ pre) / batch

    where ``post`` is the current post-synaptic spikes, ``pre_trace`` the
    pre-synaptic eligibility trace, ``post_trace`` the post-synaptic trace, and
    ``pre`` the current pre-synaptic spikes. The first (potentiating) term
    strengthens co-active pre/post targeting; the second (depressing) term,
    scaled by the distinct amplitude ``A-``, yields the characteristic STDP
    curve (net LTP for strongly correlated pre/post).
