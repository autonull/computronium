"""Canonical metrics dataclasses shared across the computronium codebase.

These provide a small, frozen+slots hierarchy so that domain-specific metric
containers (training/epoch/trial) share a common base shape (epoch, step,
extra) instead of each redefining it. ``BaseMetrics`` is the common ancestor;
``EpochMetrics`` is the canonical epoch-level container reused by benchmark
runners.
