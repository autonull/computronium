"""CampaignStack: composable facade over the campaign infrastructure.

Consolidates persistence (CampaignStore), fault tolerance (CheckpointManager),
episode evaluation, Pareto frontier analysis, counterfactual attribution, and
the replication gate behind one ``run_campaign`` entry point. The CLI and
research runners share this engine; ``run_campaign`` is deterministic per
(campaign_id, iteration): coordinate proposals, episode batches, and θ
construction all replay identically across crash/resume, and resume skips
already-recorded (iteration, coordinate, task) rows instead of duplicating
them.
