"""Family-neutral training pipeline: the single canonical train-step loop.

Every composed system generation (5-D ``_ComposedSystem``, 6-D
``_JointSystem``, adapted legacy models) delegates here. The loop settles
exactly the phases the credit rule declares (``credit.phases``), enables
autograd through settling only when the rule declares
``requires_autograd``, and returns a parity-guaranteed metrics schema.
