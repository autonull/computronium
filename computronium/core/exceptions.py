"""Domain exception hierarchy for computronium.

All library errors derive from :class:`BioplausibleError`. Subdomains
define their own leaf types so callers can catch precisely (e.g. the
AutoScientist catches :class:`TrialExecutionError` instead of bare
``Exception``). Every internal ``raise`` should chain from the original
exception: ``raise DomainError("msg") from original_exception``.
