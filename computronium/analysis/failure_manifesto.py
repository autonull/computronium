## Executive Summary

The Z3 benchmark (frozen-θ algorithm switching via ψ-mediated operator selection) reached its honest endpoint across sessions 9–14. The capability is **real but order-scoped**; the speed-vs-finetune endpoint is a **null**; order-randomization was **not confirmed**; and two v4 confirmatory attempts triaged with a residual stochastic tail. This memo records the final epistemic state for citation.

## Session-by-Session Evidence Trail

### Session 9 (Meta-Training Repair)
- **Defects corrected:** (1) ψ-logit integrator removed (unbounded random walk, ‖ψ‖: 1→157); (2) train/eval consistency: straight-through Gumbel replaces soft mixture; (3) `TASK_OPERATOR_MAP` corrected (threshold→Identity, not Threshold — linear-probe falsified original).
- **Two-phase recipe established:** forced-operator θ warm-up → controller-only straight-through phase.
- **Promoted config:** `b02_longep_wu60` (entropy_beta=0.2, episode_len=16, warmup_fraction=0.6): 1.000 / 0.988 / 0.808 (parity/lastsym/threshold).

### Session 10 (Pilot Rerun, Post-Repair)
- **Outcome:** Δθ exact both seeds; diversity H=1.42 (>log 2, no collapse); ψ-only reaches 100-step-window criterion on parity (@107–112) and last_symbol (@107–130); threshold materially above chance (0.83–0.85) but censored at 240-step budget.
- **Critical caveat:** `random_psi` control adapts essentially as well (≈1.0 / 0.99 / 0.82–0.83) — mechanism is in-episode bandit exploration over warmed-up θ trunk, NOT meta-learned routing. Frozen floor shows threshold prior (~0.99 fresh-ψ) erodes under sequential adaptation (final 0.84).

### Session 11 (Differential Rounds R4/R5)
- **R4 finding:** Cold adaptation (T≈0.5) preserves priors but starves discovery — parity dies. Pre-adaptation routing CANNOT converge for all tasks (ψ=0 ⇒ identical inputs ⇒ one task matches default).
- **Parity trilemma:** Parity operator emits label as feature ⇒ ANY broad sampler sits at metric floor (~window size). No adapter beats floor ⇒ worst-task SPEED margins ≤0 structurally.
- **R5 promoted:** `wu60_hot` (adapt_temp=2.0): 1.000/0.996/0.992, all tasks criterion-reached, Δθ exact.
- **Speed-vs-finetune: NULL** — log step ratios cluster around 0 (±0.1 at w50) across all windows {20,50,100}; identical optimizer/step budget over same trainable surface.
- **Differential vs random-ψ: RELIABILITY, not speed** — meta-training buys task coverage (100% seeds solve all 3) vs random (~60% at hot T).

### Session 12 (v2 Confirmatory, 5 Seeds, Fixed Canonical Order)
- **Gates 3/3 PASS all seeds:** Δθ exact; all-task criterion coverage; final accuracy ≥0.9789 worst-task.
- **Primary endpoint INCONCLUSIVE (E-7 null):** mean gap = 0.2577 (>0.25 margin) but bootstrap CI [0.0764, 0.4389] straddles margin; permutation p=0.1297.
- **Autopsy:** Control is bimodal — random solves all in seeds {2,3} (≈0.99), fails last_symbol in {0,1,4} (0.52–0.60). ~40% per-seed "luck rate" pins mean gap at margin. Instrument's null is Bernoulli-mixture, not Gaussian.

### Session 13 (v3 Re-registration: Proportion Endpoint + Order Randomization)
- **New design:** Exact Fisher on failure proportions (10 seeds/arm); randomized task order per seed.
- **Result NOT CONFIRMED:** Fisher p=0.5 (z3 fails 3/10 {1,2,3}; random fails 4/10 {4,6,7,8}).
- **Load-bearing finding:** ALL 7/7 failures across both arms on PARITY alone. Coverage structure:
  - Parity first ⇒ both arms solve everything (seeds 0,5,9).
  - Z3 fails iff order = (lastsym → threshold → parity), deterministically 3/3 seeds.
  - Random fails parity in 4/6 non-parity-first cells; SOLVES parity exactly where z3 fails.
- **Interpretation:** Parity carries no installed prior (pre-adapt ≈0.49–0.51 vs threshold 0.61–0.97); bandit lock-in fragile to routing basin from preceding phases.

### Session 14 (v4 System Redesign + Confirmatory Attempts)
- **Registered changes:** (1) Per-task Adam rebuild in `_adapt_all_tasks` (identical both arms); (2) Entropy floor β=0.1; (3) Gate-history rider (per-step gates/entropy persisted).
- **Coded parity REVOKED** after E-2 triage: coded quadrature/antipodal made lastsym/threshold worse; per-task Adam rebuild alone solved the starvation mechanism.
- **Budget amended:** eval_epochs_per_task 240→400 (covers max discovery latency 239 + 100-step window).
- **First confirmatory attempt (10 seeds): NOT CONFIRMED** — z3 fails seeds {2,3} (parity never discovered within 400); random 10/10 clean.
- **Gate-history census:** All 30 solved task-phases show solver-discovery latencies 1–239 steps; every failure is budget-truncation, not acquisition failure. Protocol fix works; budget was sized before latencies known.

## Final Citable Claims (Scoped Precisely)

| Claim | Status | Scope |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **θ-free ψ-mediated switching** (100–400 steps/task) | ✅ CONFIRMED | Canonical order (parity→last_symbol→threshold), 5 seeds, Δθ exact, all-task criterion coverage |
| **Speed advantage vs θ-fine-tune** | ❌ NULL | Offline re-analysis at windows {20,50,100}; no config shows stable ≥1.25× ratio |
| **Order-robust coverage** | ❌ NOT CONFIRMED | v3/v4 designs: deterministic parity failures under specific orders |
| **Meta-training buys routing skill** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Buys task COVERAGE reliability (100% vs ~60% seeds at hot T), not raw adaptation speed |

**Do NOT claim:** Zero-shot adaptation, order-robust parity, speed advantage over fine-tuning, general transformer applicability.

---

## Root-Cause Taxonomy (for Future Work)

1. **Parity self-revelation (metric flooring):** T_4 emits label as feature → random control sits at metric floor. Fix: coded parity emission (quadrature/antipodal) — REJECTED in v4 (made other tasks worse, exclusive basin deepens).
2. **Controller basin inheritance:** Shared controller (non-θ params) trained per phase; parity has no prior → lock-in depends on routing basin left by preceding phases. Fix: per-task Adam rebuild (works for acquisition, not for within-phase exploration).
3. **Exploration temperature governs everything:** Hot (T=2.0) enables discovery but sacrifices prior retention; cold preserves priors but starves discovery. No single temperature solves all three tasks robustly across orders.
4. **Metric window floors speed differences:** 100-step registered window ≥ convergence time (~30–80 steps) ⇒ ratio compression makes speed differences inexpressible.

## Closure Statement

Z3 is closed as a research line. The operator library, audit harness, and gate-history instrumentation are released as versioned artifacts for citation. The ψ/θ decoupling machinery, guard, and campaign stack are redirected to Phase 2 (continual learning flagship) where the same structural advantage — ψ-adaptation without θ-change — is tested against replay-based baselines with explicit memory accounting, on a problem (catastrophic forgetting) where backprop is structurally disadvantaged by design.

    """
    return """# Appendix: Phase 2 Continual-Learning Null Memo

## Executive Summary

The pre-registered claim — *psi/theta decoupling prevents catastrophic forgetting
better than replay at matched total memory* — was **REJECTED (E-7 null, kill
confirmed)** on Split-MNIST task-incremental, 5 seeds, paired. This memo records
the result, the arm-calibration caveat that tempers its interpretation, and the
deferred follow-ups.

---

## Design (Pre-registered via PR-4, prior to the full run)

- **Task:** Split-MNIST, 5 binary tasks (0/1, 2/3, 4/5, 6/7, 8/9), single 10-class
  output with task masking, task-incremental protocol (boundaries signaled).
- **Comparison:** FastWeightPlasticity (psi/theta decoupling, state memory) vs.
  matched-total-memory replay buffer. n=5 seeds, paired.
- **Endpoint:** backward transfer at matched memory; required superiority margin
  +0.10 (pre-registered) for the claim to survive.
- **Second comparator (informative, not pre-registered):** per-boundary forgetting.

## Result (E-7 Triage)

| Endpoint | mean_diff (fast_weights − replay) | 95% CI | p | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Backward transfer | **−0.062** | [−0.082, −0.039] | 0.0068 | fast_weights WORSE |
| Forgetting | **+0.081** | [0.073, 0.089] | 0.0034 | fast_weights forgets MORE |

Pre-registration required +0.10 superiority; the CI excludes the margin **in the
wrong direction**. Kill criterion honored; the claim is REJECTED.

## Arm-Calibration Caveat (drives Phase 3.5)

Inspection of `benchmark_results/continual_learning_full_rerun_v2/` shows the
non-replay arms were **not correctly calibrated** at the time of this run:

- **fast_weights:** final per-task accuracy ≈ 0.45–0.60 on the 10-class head —
  chance-level on every task after task 0. It was not learning subsequent tasks,
  so its high measured forgetting is confounded by failed acquisition, not a
  clean forgetting signature.
- **ewc:** tasks 1–4 also sit at chance (~0.31–0.62); only task 0 is learned.
- **backprop / lwf / si:** produce **bit-identical** accuracy matrices and
  forgetting curves — the LwF distillation and SI regularization paths were not
  taking effect (they collapse to the plain backprop loop).

**Interpretation:** the paired null reflects a broken fast_weights arm against a
working replay arm. It is a valid *negative result about the as-built pipeline*,
but it is **not** a clean test of the psi/theta-decoupling hypothesis. Phase 3.5
(single-task MNIST >=95%, two-task forgetting probe, credit-correctness, and
plasticity-state audit) is the gate that must pass before any scaling or any
re-tested CL comparison is trusted. See TODO5 §3.5.

## Artifacts

- `benchmark_results/continual_learning_full_rerun_v2/continual_learning_results.json`
  (5 seeds × 6 arms × task_incremental; accuracy matrix, BWT, forgetting,
  spectral-radius rider, stability kills).
- Pre-registration + kill decision logged in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Follow-ups (deferred / blocked)

- Permuted-MNIST 50-task stretch: **deferred** until Phase 3.5 arm verification
  passes (TODO5 §2.5).
- Re-test of the psi/theta hypothesis on verified arms: only legitimate after the
  Phase 3.5 gate, and only with a re-registration.
