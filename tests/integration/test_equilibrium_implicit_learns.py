"""Regression: implicit-differentiation ('equilibrium') method must learn at O(1).

Guards against the defect that stranded run_phase1_5.py eqprop models on
BPTT. Historically FIX.md claimed the implicit method "fails to learn due to a
gradient-quality issue" — the real cause was that
:meth:`BioModel._get_spectral_normalized_weight` returned a *detached* weight
when ``model.eval()`` was set during ``EquilibriumFunction.backward``, killing
the recurrent weight's gradient entirely (``W_rec.grad is None``).

These tests assert:
1. ``equilibrium`` gradients match full BPTT (relative error is small).
2. Every learnable parameter receives a real gradient (no silent ``None``).
3. ``equilibrium`` actually drives training loss down on a deterministic task.

Migrated to native compositions after legacy zoo removal.
