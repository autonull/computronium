"""D7 — The D-axis settles in time.

The same coordinate — Feedforward × Null × Backprop × Euclidean on the
digital substrate — is trained twice on MNIST through identical
``SystemTrainer`` wiring; the only difference between arms is the state
dynamics. ``InstantaneousDynamics`` settles in a single pass;
``SpikeIntegrationDynamics`` settles layer-wise: every Linear transition
integrates constant drive into LIF membranes (spike at threshold, reset)
for ``max_steps`` steps, and the settled membrane carries activity to the
next layer. Before the layer-wise settle, this exact build crashed at
settle step 1 — ``route`` maps input width to output width, so any
input ≠ output feedforward build mismatched; the D-axis simply could not
compose with a classifier. The runner watches the physics: both arms
learn through the same wiring, the trained LIF network fires visibly
(every threshold crossing is counted per settle step), and its membranes
come back bounded by the spike threshold — the Lyapunov lock, live.

Demonstrated regime (live sweep 2026-09-02): MNIST quick-mode train
stream capped at 300 batches, 1 epoch, hidden ``(32,)``, Euclidean step
0.05, LIF ``max_steps=10`` -> accuracy ≈ 0.87 instant / 0.85 spike
(chance 0.1; the gap is not the claim — training through the settle is).
Post-training probe on one held batch: 20 (layer, step) spike-count
entries, ≈ 1.8k total spikes, membrane max ≈ 0.92 < threshold 1.0.
