"""D6 — The substrate axis is physical.

The same coordinate — Feedforward × Instantaneous × Null × Backprop ×
Euclidean — is trained five times on MNIST through identical
``SystemTrainer`` wiring; the only difference between arms is the substrate.
``create_backprop_mlp`` runs on the digital substrate (native execution);
``create_memristive_mlp`` swaps the S-axis to memristive physics — signed
weights realized as differential-pair conductances (every device bounded
in [0, 1] with int8 straight-through quantization, the pair difference
carrying the sign) and activations carrying IR-drop noise of
``noise_level`` standard deviations; ``create_neuromorphic_mlp`` swaps it
to neuromorphic physics — the state thinned to the active spike set each
forward step (each element survives with probability ``1 - sparsity``,
functional spike dropout off the ambient seeded stream). The runner watches
the physics, not a metric table: at mild IR-drop the pair's signed range
learns nearly as well as digital, at severe IR-drop the noise walls
learning at chance; at mild spike dropout the surviving spikes still carry
the signal, at the default 0.95 sparsity the thinning walls it — the
physical constraint, not the algorithm, decides. Each arm's substrate is
probed post-training: the recorded zeros fraction of a ones state is the
dial itself.

Demonstrated regime (re-pinned 2026-09-02 under differential-pair
conductance + functional spike-dropout semantics): MNIST quick-mode train
stream capped at 1000 batches (batch 32), 1 epoch, hidden ``(32,)``,
Euclidean step 0.05, IR-drop noise 1.5 (mild) vs 8.0 (severe), spike
dropout 0.5 (mild) vs 0.95 (severe, the config default) -> accuracy ≈ 0.91
digital / 0.78 memristive-mild / 0.12 memristive-severe / 0.70
neuromorphic-mild / 0.11 neuromorphic-severe (chance 0.1). Live IR-drop
sweep 2026-09-02: noise 0.5 -> 0.89, 3.0 -> 0.56, 6.0 -> 0.22 — the
staircase is monotone; 8.0 walls the arm, so the severe arm's contrast is
categorical by regime choice, not by guard band. (Under the pre-pair
unsigned-clamp semantics the same dial walled at 3.0; the signed pair
doubles the signal path and moved the wall.)
