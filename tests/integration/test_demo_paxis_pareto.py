"""F3 — The P-axis Pareto, audited: primitives realized, confound still live.

CP-6 Path B, E-1 smoke promoted, mechanism-audited (R11.5.5a), then the
audit's registered realization gap CLOSED (2026-09-05) and re-audited.
Measured facts, locked live below:

1. RoutingPlasticity is REALIZED: the gate drive is a fixed per-gate
   input projection (gates differentiate across units AND samples) and
   modulate applies per-unit sigmoid masks (per-layer fixed gate→unit
   projection) — the old constant-0.5 scalar gain is gone. The per-unit
   mask std is 0.081 at this regime (asserted live > 0.05): real
   per-sample, per-unit routing over the network's units (the flat-MLP
   re-spec of pathway gating — a dense geometry has no distinct physical
   pathways to mask).
2. The retention advantage SURVIVES realization (routing 0.273 vs null
   0.194, ≥ null 4/5 seeds) — but the lr-MATCHED control (E-1 pilot,
   promoted) DISSOLVES it: routing's effective step is exactly half of
   null's (displacement 0.0014 vs 0.0028, matched null lr ≈ 0.0154 =
   the mask-mean-0.5 prediction) and null@matched retains 0.294. The
   ordering is effective learning rate ALONE — no routing mechanism
   claim is quotable from retention (asserted live). FastWeight's step
   size matches null's (0.032 ≈ 0.03): its retention deficit
   (0.155 vs 0.194) is REAL — the injection genuinely hurts at this
   scale (also asserted).
3. FastWeightPlasticity is REALIZED: ψ steps on the first phase's
   SETTLED activity (the pipeline passes the settled output as post —
   the old contract received the raw target, making the modulation a
   target-correlated bias). The modulation stays gradient-live: θ
   separates from null by ~3.4%/episode from identical inits (monotone,
   asserted). Retention lands below null (0.155 vs 0.194) and its
   episode latency carries the ψ-update cost the compute proxy cannot
   see (asserted live > 1.1× null).

What the Pareto itself shows (5 seeds, registered A40/B40 regime): the
scalar axes separate the arms (retention, basin width, ψ-capacity) —
the E-1 gate for the registered-scale campaign. Mechanisms realized,
and the retention axis is now CONFOUNDED-BY-CONSTRUCTION: its ordering
is effective-lr alone (lr-matched audit, locked live). The registered
campaign must therefore measure retention at matched effective lr per
arm — the campaign-design deliverable of this pilot — before any
P-axis mechanism figure is drawn.
